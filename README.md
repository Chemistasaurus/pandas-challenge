Took two csv files and read them into pandas. Merged the two datasets.

Counted the total number of schools and students.

Calculated following information for the district:![image](https://github.com/Chemistasaurus/pandas-challenge/assets/132176159/79366ece-541e-4660-86d0-f9aa84c14f5b)

  Formatted the values in the dataframe.
  
Calculated and store the values for each individual school for per student budget, average math score, average reading score, percent passing score for math and reading as well as overall passing score into one dataframe.

  Formatted the values in the individual school statistic dataframe.
  
Sorted the data by % of students that had passing scores in both math and reading. Descending to find the top scorers and ascending to find the bottom scorers.

  The five highest scoring schools were all charter schools and the five lowest scoring schools are district schools.
  
Filtered the school data to find average scores in math and reading by the grade of the students.

  There was less variation between the different grades at the same school than there was between students in the same grade at different schools.
  
  There was more variation between math scores when comparing different schools than between reading scores at different schools.

Grouped the data into spending ranges to see the effects of higher spending on test scores.

  The lower the spending per student, the higher the score in math, reading and overall.

Grouped the data into size ranges to see if the size of the school correlates with overall student performance.
  
  With one slight exception, the larger the school, the lower the test scores, especially in math. The largest schools had a significantly lower percentage of students that passed both math and reading than the medium and small schools.

  Organized the scoring data by type of school.
  
    Charter schools did significantly better than district schools in all areas of testing.
    
    Charter schools, on average, had half as many students as district schools.
